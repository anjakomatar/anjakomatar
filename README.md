- 👋 Hi, I’m @anjakomatar
- 👀 I’m interested in data science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to deal with actual data. As a mathematician I can teach people how the maths behind the statistics works, but now it's time to do something useful.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that need my maths skills and teach me something new.
- 📫 How to reach me: mxanjakomatar@gmail.com
